# About Easy-Speed
Easy-Speed project focuses on creating a simple but effective tool that allows users to measure their internet speed. By visiting the toolâ€™s website(http://34.17.87.58:3030/), users can easily measure key network metrics such as ping, download speed, and upload speed. This tool is hosted on a Google Cloud server, making it accessible to a wide audience, and it aims to provide accurate results quickly while using minimal data (100MB maximum).
